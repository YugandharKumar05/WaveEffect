#  Wave Effect Demo 🌊🐢
A fun and interactive Android app showcasing wave animations and user interactions using Jetpack Compose. This project blends animation, user input, and dynamic visuals to create an engaging and playful experience.

# Features ✨
Dynamic Wave Animation: A flowing wave at the bottom of the screen simulates realistic water movement using Canvas and mathematical calculations.

# Interactive Slider: Adjust the slider to change:
The wave's height.
A timer-like display showing hh:mm based on the wave percentage.
Easter Egg: A floating turtle icon appears along the wave. Clicking it reveals a fun message:
# "🐢 You've found the turtle! 🐢"

Smooth Animations: Continuous wave motion, synchronized turtle movement, and transitions create a visually fluid experience.

Replace this with an actual GIF or image showcasing your app.

# How to Use 🛠️ ? 
*  Wave Animation:
          Watch the animated wave at the bottom of the screen.
          The wave height and position adjust dynamically as the slider changes.
*  Timer Display:
          The text at the center of the screen updates to show a time representation (in hh:mm) corresponding to the slider value.
*  Turtle Interaction
          Look for the floating turtle along the wave.
          Tap the turtle to reveal the Easter egg message.

# Installation 🚀
Clone the repository:
# git clone https://github.com/your-username/wave-effect-demo.git

Open the project in Android Studio.
Sync Gradle and build the project.
Run the app on an emulator or physical device.
Technologies Used 🛠️
* Kotlin: Primary programming language.
* Jetpack Compose: For building declarative UI components and animations.
* Canvas API: For custom drawing of the wave.
* State Management: Using remember and mutableStateOf for managing UI state.
* Animation APIs: For creating infinite transitions and smooth turtle movement.

# Code Highlights 📌
* Wave Animation:
        Uses trigonometric functions (sin) to simulate wave movement.
        Animates the wave with a continuous infinite transition.
* Interactive Timer:
Dynamically updates based on the slider value.
Converts the value into hh:mm format using custom logic.
* Composable Structure:
Components like WaveView, Slider, and Text are modular and reusable.
*Use Cases 🌟
* Learning Project: Explore Jetpack Compose's capabilities with animations, state handling, and Canvas drawing.
* UI Experimentation: Develop and test creative animations and interactive UI elements.
* Gamified Apps: Add playful elements like Easter eggs to boost user engagement.
